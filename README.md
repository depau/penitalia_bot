# PenitaliaBot

A Telegram bot that uses the Windows text-to-speech API to read out loud the
messages sent to it. It uses
the [SAPISpeechServer](https://github.com/depau/SAPISpeechServer) to do so,
therefore it can also run on Linux.

The name has to do with the default voice in the official bot instance, which
*might* remind something to people who have traveled around Italy.

The bot is currently running on Telegram as
[@PenitaliaBot](https://t.me/PenitaliaBot).
